# Overview

This is a program that recreates the popular nonogram puzzles (also known as Hanjie, Paint by Numbers, Picross, Griddlers, Pic-a-Pix, as specified by Wikipedia)

I have named it Picross since that was the nonogram version I played
Here is the Wikipedia link if you are interested [Wikipedia Nonograms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonogram)


## Controls

Left click: add a black space

Right click: add an x (usually indicates that a black space can't be there)

Shift click (left or right): add a spacer (many people use these differently I use them as theoretical x marks)

## Demo Video

Here is a video I made that demonstrates the program

This project was developed in Visual Studio

It is written in C++ and has used these dependencies 

windows.h
iostream
vector
array
time.h

# Useful Websites

Microsoft's documentation was priceless for this project
* [Microsoft Documentation on Making a Windows Application](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/walkthrough-creating-windows-desktop-applications-cpp?view=msvc-160)
* [Geeks for Geeks C++ Webpage](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-plus-plus/?ref=shm)
* [Devdocs C++ Webpage](https://devdocs.io/cpp/)

# Future Work

Here are a few things that I would like to add in the future.
* Keyboard controls as opposed to mouse controls
* Holding a key while moving over spaces to count, making larger puzzles a lot easier
* Puzzle checking to make sure that a given puzzle can be completed
* Menu for puzzle customization
* Saving puzzles to files and importing them
* Intelligent puzzle creation that could grab from an image
